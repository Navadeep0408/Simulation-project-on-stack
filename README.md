# Simulation-project-on-stack
This project simulates a Stack data structure in C using the LIFO principle. It supports push, pop, peek, and display operations. Stacks are widely used in undo features, expression evaluation, recursion, and browser navigation. The program demonstrates how stack operations work internally.

## What is a Stack?
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.
The last item inserted is the first to be removed.

## Operations Implemented
1. Push (Insert)
2. Pop (Delete)
3. Peek (View top element)
4. Display (Show all elements)

## Applications of Stack
- Undo operations in editors
- Function call stack (recursion)
- Expression evaluation (postfix/prefix)
- Checking balanced parentheses
- Browser back/forward navigation
