# Simulation-project-on-stack
This project simulates a Stack data structure in C using the LIFO principle. It supports push, pop, peek, and display operations. Stacks are widely used in undo features, expression evaluation, recursion, and browser navigation. The program demonstrates how stack operations work internally.
